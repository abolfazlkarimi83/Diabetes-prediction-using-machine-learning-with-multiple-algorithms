#  Diabetes Prediction Project

Welcome to my Diabetes Prediction Project!  
In this notebook, I explore the famous Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and build several machine learning models to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes.

##  About the Project

This project aims to:
- Analyze and visualize the dataset.
- Handle missing or zero values.
- Normalize the data.
- Train and evaluate several machine learning models.
- Compare their performance visually.

##  Used Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for classic machine learning models
- XGBoost for gradient boosting
- Jupyter Notebook for clean step-by-step workflow

##  Installation & Running

Make sure you have Python installed (>=3.7).  
Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

Clone this repository and open the notebook:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
cd diabetes-prediction
jupyter notebook Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb
```

Replace `"your-username"` with your actual GitHub username.

##  Project Structure & What I Did

- **Import libraries:** Imported all required libraries for data processing, visualization, and modeling.
- **Load dataset:** Loaded the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.
- **Data inspection:** Explored basic info, summary statistics, and checked for zero values.
- **Data visualization:**
  - Histograms to see distributions.
  - Heatmap to explore correlations.
  - Boxplots to spot outliers.
  - Countplot to see class balance.
- **Data preprocessing:**
  - Replaced zeros with median values (for Glucose, BloodPressure, etc.).
  - Scaled features using StandardScaler.
- **Splitting the dataset:** Used train-test split with random_state for reproducibility.
- **Model training:** Trained multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, XGBoost) step by step.
- **Evaluation:** Calculated accuracy scores.
- **Visualization:** Compared model accuracies using bar plots.

##  Challenges & Why Accuracy Wasn't Very High

 **Imbalanced dataset:** About 65% of the patients in the dataset are non-diabetic, which biases the models.

 **Data limitations:**
- Small dataset (~768 rows).
- Missing clinical features that could improve prediction (family history, diet, exercise, etc.).

 **Class overlap:** The features for diabetic and non-diabetic patients overlap a lot, which limits model performance.

Despite these challenges, the project still demonstrates important machine learning workflows: preprocessing, training, tuning, and visualization.

##  Possible Improvements

- Use more advanced models like neural networks.
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV).
- Use oversampling techniques (SMOTE) to balance classes.
- Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction (PCA).
